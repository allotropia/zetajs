An example of a Web form letter demo, using a stripped-down, standalone Writer document canvas
without any surrounding menubars, toolbars, side panels, etc.

To run the example, do:
```
npm install
npm start
```

Attention: When using in production, replace the zetajs 'file:' link in `package.json` with a proper version from npmjs.com.
