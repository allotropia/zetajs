# zetajs: Access ZetaOffice in the Browser from JavaScript via UNO

The zetajs library provides the facilities to run an instance of ZetaOffice integrated in your
web site, allowing you to control it with JavaScript code via the LibreOffice
[UNO](https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Documentation/DevGuide) technology.

Use cases range from an in-browser office suite that looks and feels just like its desktop
counterpart, to fine-tuned custom text editing and spreadsheet capabilities embedded in your web
site, to a headless zetajs instance that does document conversion in the background.

For a detailed description of zetajs, see the [Starting Points](docs/start.md) documentation.

(Technically, zetajs provides a wrapper on top of the
[Embind-based](https://blog.allotropia.de/2024/04/30/libreoffice-javascripted/) JavaScript scripting
capabilities for LibreOffice. But it aims to provide a nicer, more idiomatic JavaScript experience,
and completely hides the underlying machinery. In the future, it may even move away from that
underlying Embind layer, in a backward-compatible way.)

## Why zetajs

See how zetajs makes scripting ZetaOffice easy, building on the foundation of the LibreOffice UNO API:

### 1. Load a document

```javascript
const css = zetajs.uno.com.sun.star;
const desktop = css.frame.Desktop.create(zetajs.getUnoComponentContext());
let xModel = desktop.getCurrentFrame().getController().getModel();
if (!xModel?.queryInterface(zetajs.type.interface(css.text.XTextDocument))) {
    xModel = desktop.loadComponentFromURL(
        'file:///android/default-document/example.odt', '_default', 0, []);
}
```

### 2. Change each paragraph in Writer into a random color

```javascript
const xText = xModel.getText();
const xParaEnumeration = xText.createEnumeration();
for (const xParagraph of xParaEnumeration) {
    const color = Math.floor(Math.random() * 0xFFFFFF);
    xParagraph.setPropertyValue("CharColor", color);
}
```

## Using with an own build

Please have a look into the respective config.sample.js file of each demo to use another ZetaOffice build.

You may also compile a custom [LOWA build](https://git.libreoffice.org/core/+/refs/heads/master/static/README.wasm.md). There the folder `workdir/installation/LibreOffice/emscripten/` will contain the files for the web root. If you host the WASM binary on another origin then the example code you will need to set a [CORS header](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS).

For the sources of the WASM binaries served by cdn.zetaoffice.net see:
* https://git.libreoffice.org/core/+/refs/heads/distro/allotropia/zeta-24-2
* https://github.com/allotropia/emscripten/commits/fixed-3.1.65
